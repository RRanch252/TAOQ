# Thinking in Systems â€” Donella H. Meadows

## Summary

*Thinking in Systems* offers a lucid introduction to systems thinking as a powerful lens for understanding complexity. This book shows us that systems are everywhere, and understanding their structure is key to effective intervention.

## Key Concepts

### 1. System Structure
A system is more than the sum of its parts. It's an interconnected set of elements organized to achieve a purpose.

### 2. Feedback Loops
Two types of feedback loops govern system behavior: balancing loops and reinforcing loops.

## Notable Quotes

> "The behavior of a system cannot be known just by knowing the elements of which the system is made."

## Personal Reflections

This book fundamentally altered how I perceive the world. Where I once saw isolated problems, I now see interconnected systems.
