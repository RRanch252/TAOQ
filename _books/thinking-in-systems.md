*Thinking in Systems* offers a lucid, accessible introduction to systems thinking as a powerful lens for understanding and navigating complexity. Meadows shows us that systems are everywhere, and understanding their structure is key to effective intervention.

## Key Concepts

### System Structure
A system is more than the sum of its parts. It's an interconnected set of elements organized to achieve a purpose. Three essential components define every system:
- **Elements**: The visible, tangible parts
- **Interconnections**: The relationships that hold elements together  
- **Purpose**: The function or goal of the system

### Feedback Loops
Two types of feedback loops govern system behavior:
- **Balancing Loops**: Seek equilibrium and stability
- **Reinforcing Loops**: Amplify or accelerate change

## Notable Quotes

> "The behavior of a system cannot be known just by knowing the elements of which the system is made."

> "Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model."

## Personal Reflections

This book fundamentally altered how I perceive the world. Where I once saw isolated problems requiring isolated solutions, I now see interconnected systems with multiple intervention points.
